      <p>
        Joining Redmi Note 9S in Xiaomi's 2020 budget phone range in the UK is this Redmi Note 9 and a higher-spec Note
        9 Pro. For those on tight budgets the 9 is very slightly cheaper than the 9S, but sacrifices some screen estate,
        the Snapdragon 720G and a few additional features.
      </p>

      <p>
        Promising the same high-capacity 5,020mAh battery that drove the 9S to the top of our phone battery charts, and
        a very similar quad-lens rear camera, we consider whether the small saving is enough to sway you in favour of
        the younger sibling.
      </p>

      <p>
        Note that as of 28 August 2020, Redmi Note 9 is now additionally available on contract or SIM-free in the UK
        through Three (skip to where to buy Redmi Note 9).
      </p>

      <h1 id="design">Design & Build – Subtle Savings</h1>

      <p>
        Redmi Note 9 is a fine-looking phone, especially in our review sample's Midnight Grey colour scheme. It is also
        available in Forest Green and Polar White.
      </p>

      <p>
        It should not surprise you to learn it has a very familiar design, both among modern Android phones in general
        and the Redmi Note 9 range specifically, but look closer and you'll find there is a number of important
        differences between this and the more expensive models in the line.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most immediately apparent is that this model lacks the high-gloss mirror shine of its siblings. It's not a bad
        thing: the subtlety this creates is appealing, and the phone is much less prone to fingerprints. Redmi Note 9 is
        still glossy, just not aggressively so.
      </p>

      <p>
        The reason for this lack of gloss is simple: Xiaomi has swapped out the 9S' glass rear and metal frame for a
        plastic body in the Note 9. This sounds like a bigger deal than it is, and the newest Xiaomi phone does a pretty
        good job of retaining the line's high-quality design.
      </p>

      <p>
        It feels well-made and durable, not waterproof but P2i splashproof (as you would expect with most budget
        phones), with no creaky bits or harsh lines, and we’d wager that it’s less likely to shatter when dropped.
        Arguably, though, it also looks less premium.
      </p>

      <h1 id="perf">Performance – No Competition</h1>

      <p>
        One of the big differences in Redmi Note 9 over 9S and 9 Pro is that it swaps out the Snapdragon 720G chip from
        Qualcomm in favour of a Helio G85 processor from MediaTek. This is a 2GHz octa-core chip, integrated with the
        ARM Mali-G52 graphics processor, as opposed to the 720G’s Adreno 618.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is paired with 3GB or 4GB of RAM (and 64GB or 128GB of storage), whereas the more expensive models in the
        Redmi Note 9 line benefit from 4GB or 6GB of memory.
      </p>

      <p>
        This processor selection will have helped Xiaomi to cut down on costs, but in my opinion it was a poor decision.
        The Tech Advisor team runs all phones through a selection of benchmarks to give a point of reference for
        performance comparisons, and it seems the Redmi Note 9 is at rather a significant disadvantage to its siblings
        in terms of overall processing power.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Geekbench 5 performance tests we found the Redmi Note 9 very much on par with the
        <a href="https://www.techadvisor.com/article/721226/moto-g8-power-review.html">Moto G8 Power</a>, an only
        slightly more expensive phone that also goes big on the battery, albeit somewhat more successfully. Other
        smartphones that scored similar results in this test include the
        <a href="https://www.techadvisor.com/article/720795/honor-9x-review.html">Honor 9X</a> and
        <a href="https://www.techadvisor.com/article/720610/nokia-6-2-review.html">Nokia 6.2</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        In an age in which battery life is everything, the 5,020mAh spec of Redmi Note 9’s battery would lead you to
        believe runtime is going to excel. Redmi Note 9S, which has the same 5,020mAh cell, delivered a class-leading
        battery life of 15 hours 3 minutes under the Geekbench 4 battery test; Redmi Note 9 managed just 8 hours 15
        minutes under the same conditions.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a poor battery score for a budget phone, but it is a poor battery score for a phone that too many
        consumers will rush out and buy based entirely on that excellent on-paper battery spec, without reading reviews
        such as this to find out what it’s really good for.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is true to say that synthetic benchmarks are not always representative of real life, and we would expect that
        most users would nevertheless manage to get a full day’s usage without needing to reach for the charger. Some
        users will even get two days, since how long the battery lasts depends on for what you use it.
      </p>

      <h1 id="cameras">Cameras & Photography – Lacking Focus</h1>

      <p>
        With Redmi Note 9 it feels a bit like Xiaomi has jumped on the quad-lens camera bandwagon, without due care or
        attention. Neither its macro nor depth sensors are really pulling much weight here. But a quad-camera certainly
        sounds great on paper, especially when headlining with a 48MP lens.
      </p>

      <p>
        Although it might appear to be a similar camera to what you find on Redmi Note 9S, it’s probably closer to that
        of the previous-generation Redmi Note 8T, albeit in a square rather than portrait assembly. It’s also combining
        48MP wide (f/1.79, 0.8um), 8MP ultra-wide (f/2.2, 1.12um), 2MP macro (f/2.4, 1.75um) and 2MP depth (f/2.4,
        1.75um) sensors for general photography, along with a 13MP camera for selfies. It has a 2x digital zoom, but no
        optical offering.
      </p>

      <img class="responsive-image" src="./fig/xiaomi1.jpg" alt="" />

      <h1 id="software">Software – MIUI 11</h1>

      <p>
        Our review sample is running the global version of MIUI 11, a custom version of Android. As we found on Redmi
        Note 9S, it is missing some of the features you’ll find in the best Xiaomi phones, such as the Always-on
        Display.
      </p>

      <p>
        In this version Xiaomi has unlocked the system-wide Dark Mode, and you’ll also benefit from superb features that
        are exclusive to Xiaomi, such as Dual Apps and Second Space. These are incredibly useful if you’re making use of
        the dual-SIM functionality, or want to wall off some content to a protected area.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is also the first time we’ve actually seen the option to add an app drawer to MIUI, which is turned off by
        default. (This has been reported to be present in all Xiaomi phones running MIUI 11’s global ROM, but in our
        experience this is untrue.) Switch on this feature and the Redmi Note 9 acts a lot more like a regular Android
        phone.
      </p>
